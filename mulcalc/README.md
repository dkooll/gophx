# Requirements

### Input parsing:

Scan the corrupted memory for valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions. Extract the integers X and Y from each valid instruction.

### Validation:

Ensure that only valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions are processed. Ignore any invalid characters or malformed instructions.

### Multiplication:

For each valid `mul(X,Y)` instruction, multiply the integers X and Y to get the result.

### Summing results:

Compute the total sum of all multiplication results. Display the individual results of each multiplication and the overall total to reconcile the corrupted memory effectively.
