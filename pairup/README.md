# Requirements

Input Parsing

Prepare two lists of integers representing location IDs gathered by two groups. Ensure these lists are ready for processing.

Sorting

Arrange both lists in ascending order to align the smallest numbers in each list for comparison.

Pairwise Difference Calculation

For each pair of aligned integers from the two lists, calculate the absolute difference to measure how far apart they are.

Summing Differences

Compute the total of all absolute differences and display the results, including the individual differences and the overall total, to reconcile the two lists effectively.
