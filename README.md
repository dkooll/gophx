# gophx

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with various small Go projects and refactoring existing ones.

It explores different techniques and implementations, focusing on improving code quality and efficiency.

Some projects may grow into ongoing initiatives, but the primary focus is on experimentation.

## Notes

For now the approach is just to define a interface with the methods you want to implement.

Then create a struct that holds the data and implements the methods.

And these methods encapsulate the logic.
